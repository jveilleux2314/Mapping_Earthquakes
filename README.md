# Mapping_Earthquakes

# Purpose
We used data from major earthquakes from the last 7 days and mapped them to visually display the magnitude and location of each event. My maps are versatile to be seen on a dark or light map, and gives the user the option to select tectonic plates, earthquakes and major earth quakes - or ALL three at once.
